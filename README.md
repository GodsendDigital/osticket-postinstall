Once osTicket is installed, I begin to create the admin account to essentially control everything. This admin account can create agents, other admins, teams, SLAs, Help Topics, and more.

Now I must create agents accounts that will act as an employee of a company. The agents answer tickets of clients that need technical support. Agents can be order to answer a ticket from management. The tickets can require immediate attention or can be address in a timely manner. Some companies have Service Level Agreements and SLA are a target the agent have to meet pertaining tickets such as
  - How quickly a ticket is a assigned to an agent
  - How quickly the agent initially reach out to the user who created the ticket
  - How often the agent communicate with the user until the issue is solved
  - How quickly the issue is solve
Tickets will often have a severity assigned to them which is defined by the organization, but the severity is usually related to the business impact. Severity often defines the SLA.
  - Severity-A: High Impact(1hour, 24/7)
  - Severity-B: Medium Impact(4hour, 24/7)
  - Severity-C: Low Impact(8hour, Business hours)
